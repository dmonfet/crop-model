This project includes crop models in folders that were used in various studied that were published by members of LTSB.
The crop models are TRNSYS components that can be use to estimate the latent heat gain and convective heat gain/loss induced by crops. 
It can be used as inputs to the Type56 Multizone Building to include crops as internal heat gains/losses in a thermal zone.


DESCRIPTION OF THE CROP (LETTUCE) STEADY-STATE MODEL
-----------------------------------
- It models lettuces growing inside a controlled environnement in a hydroponic production system according to a validated algorithm (Graamans et al., 2017).
- It is a steady-state model since the size of crops do not vary with the time; thus the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the cultivation is set as a simulation parameter in this version of the crop model.
- This version of crops model can only be used in a space where LED lamps are used to grow crops.
